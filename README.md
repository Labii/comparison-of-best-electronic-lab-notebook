# Comparison of The Best Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)
There are tons of electronic lab notebook out there, but only few of them are actually usable. It usually took months for a scientist to decide which ELN is the right software to go. Here, I tested all available ELNs and summarized their features. Hopefully, it is useful for you to find the right ELN.

All data was collected based on the date of 2017-07-26, version v0.1.
