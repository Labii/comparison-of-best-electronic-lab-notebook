# Comparison of The Best Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)
There are tons of electronic lab notebook out there, but only few of them are actually usable. It usually took months for a scientist to decide which ELN is the right software to go. Here, We tested all available cloud-based ELNs and summarized their features. Hopefully, it is useful for you to find the right ELN.

All data was collected based on the date of 2017-07-26, version v0.1. We will update the information annually. Please suggest a change by creating an issue. All rights reserved @Labii Inc.

## List of ELNs

We collected the list of ELN from google, linkedin and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ELN_software_packages). This is a list of ELN that been most well-known and most commonly used.

## Comparison of Features

What makes a ELN? There are no specific answers. An ELN need to keep the purpose of documenting research data, and keeping the fact of research as accurate as possible. We selected a list of features that are required in the process of experimentation. See the details of each features bellow.

Here, we do not consider a software like google docs, microsoft word, evernote or microsoft onenote as electronic lab notebook. Because the results can be easily deleted.
